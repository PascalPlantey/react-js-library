 * Enables a basic switch within the render of a component. The provided 'cases' is an array in which each element is an object with
 * two properties 'condition' & 'action', where 'condition' is a boolean and 'action' a function (returning JSX) or a JSX value.
 * The cases are evaluated in order and the value returned is the first one which condition is true. The last case can be
 * with an undefined 'condition' which is considered as the default return value. If no default is provided Switch returns null.
 * @param {Array} cases Component props [{ condition: c1, action: a1 }, { condition: c2, action: a2 }, ...]
